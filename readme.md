### Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.


### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/beratcelik/Supply-Chain-Tracing.git
```

Change directory to ```Project6``` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
cd Project6
npm install
```
In a separate terminal window, Compile smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
```

This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle migrate
```

Test smart contracts:

```
truffle test
```

All 10 tests should pass.
In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:

```
npm run dev
```
### Example
A running copy of the smart contract on Rinkeby Test Network can be reached via
```
